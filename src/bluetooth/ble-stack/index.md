# BLE

To work with Bluetooth Low Energy, we need to understand several key concepts. I'll keep it simple and cover just enough to get you started without overwhelming you with too many details. So, buckle up, and let's jump in.


## BLE Stack
The image below illustrates the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol stack.  The BLE stack is the foundation of communication between BLE devices. We won't go into the Controller (lower layers) in detail, as it's not essential for our purpose. However, understanding key concepts in the Host part, such as GAP and GATT, is important.

### GAP => How devices connect and communicate

GAP (Generic Access Profile) defines how BLE devices advertise, connect, and establish communication. It covers device roles (e.g., central, peripheral), connection parameters, and security modes. GAP is responsible for how devices find each other and initiate communication.

### GATT => How devices exchange and structure data

GATT (Generic Attribute Profile) defines how BLE devices exchange data. It organizes data in a hierarchy of services and characteristics, allowing clients (e.g., a smartphone app) to read, write, and subscribe to updates from a BLE peripheral (e.g., a sensor).
