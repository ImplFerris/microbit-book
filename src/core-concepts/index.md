# Core concepts

This section primarily covers theoretical concepts. Feel free to skip it and dive into the exercises instead. As you work through the exercises related to each concept, we'll link back to the theory. This way, you can learn by doing and understand the theory as it becomes relevant - and it will be more fun too.
