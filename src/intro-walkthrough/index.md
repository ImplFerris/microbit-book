# Project Walkthrough

We have successfully flashed and run our first program, which creates a blinking effect. However, we have not yet explored the code or the project structure in detail. In this section, we will recreate the same project from scratch instead of using the template. I will explain each part of the code and configuration along the way. Let's dive in.

## Create a Fresh Project

We will start by creating a standard Rust binary project. Use the following command:

```bash
cargo new blinky
```
